### PMBA Readme

Instructions for the team that is testing
* You can login as an administrator using "admin@email.sc.edu" and "password" as the password
* You can login as a student using "ACarrico@email.com" and "password" as the password
* Every student's password is "password"
* The email functions don't actually send emails, because it is disabled. Normally it would send out registration, help, etc.. emails but that doesn't make sense because the email addresses we are using are fake.


Instructions for unit and integration testing
  The testing modules use mocha, chai, and chai-http as their foundation.
  The command to run the tests is "meteor test --driver-package practicalmeteor:mocha."
