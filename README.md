This is the readme for PMBA.

### Instructions for the team that is testing
* You can login as an administrator using "admin@email.sc.edu" and "password" as the password
* You can login as a student using "ACarrico@email.com" and "password" as the password
* Every student's password is "password"
* The email functions don't actually send emails, because it is disabled. Normally it would send out registration, help, etc.. emails but that doesn't make sense because the email addresses we are using are fake.
