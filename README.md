This is the readme for PMBA. Once the project gets underway more information about the project will go here.

Instructions for preparing GITHub for the project on your local machine (If you don't want to watch youtube videos)

Open GitHub
Click on the plus sign in the top left corner
Choose clone
Find pmba in the SCCapstone group
Choose a local directory to house the files

Once this is done you can add files to your local folder, sync, and the whole group can have access to it.
